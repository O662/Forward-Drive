task main()                          //The 'task main' is "start" for the code, much like a race, where you need a place to start, this 
                                     //is where the code begins to run.
{                                    //a opening bracket is is what the cose reads,like in our race example earlier, this is the starting 
                                     //gun
	motor[rightMotor] = 63;      //the 'motor[rightMotor]' call upon the motor and the'[rightMotor]' tells the code which motor
	motor[leftMotor] = 63;       //the same for the right motor is the same for the left.
	wait1Msec(5000);             //the time is basically a loop, what ever is above the command is repeted until the time that is set 
	                             // is up
}                                    //the ending bracket is also very important, because with out it your code is undefined and will 
                                     //continue forever

// This is just an example, you are free to change the numbers.
